   This is the dice rolling game Farkle. It's a game in which one or more players try to score a predetermined number of points based on the dice that they roll. On their turn, each player will roll six dice. If they roll a one, five, three of a kind, or straight of five to six dice in a row, they earn points that add up to their total score. This was the final project for one of my classes in August of 2020.
